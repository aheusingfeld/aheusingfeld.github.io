<p>
At the time of writing this blog post everything is prepared and I'm already really excited about my very first flight to the States and therefore my very first <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/">Oracle JavaOne</a>. 
As my talk proposal for JavaOne has been accepted by the conference committee - thanks again -, I'm even going to be a speaker at JavaOne 2012.

<p>
The talk I'm going to give together with <a href="http://www.reucon.com">Stefan Reuter</a> is titled "<a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=6960">Enterprise Application Integration patterns for Java EE cloud applications (CON6960)</a>" and will focus on the following objectives:
<ol>
<li> Provide basic knowledge of EAI and <a href="http://eaipatterns.com">EAI patterns</a></li>
<li> Show possible implementations of common EAI patterns with <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration/">Spring Integration</a></li>
<li> Present benefits and shortcomings of cloud-based EAI applications</li>
</ol>
</p>
