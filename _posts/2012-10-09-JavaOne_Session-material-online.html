Oracle just published screen & audio recordings of all sessions at JavaOne 2012. 
The files for our session "<a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=6960">Enterprise Application Integration patterns for Java EE cloud applications (CON6960)</a>"
and all others are available in the <a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/search.ww?event=javaone">Oracle JavaOne Content Catalog</a>.

The slides for our talk are also still available at Github via the URL

I also uploaded some of the pictures taken before, during and after JavaOne to a
