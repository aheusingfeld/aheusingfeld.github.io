This is the source of my blog @github [http://aheusingfeld.github.io/](http://aheusingfeld.github.io/) which is powered by Jekyll, Github Actions, and Github Pages. 

The reason I chose this setup over Github Pages alone is that I want to write in [AsciiDoc](http://asciidoc.org/) via [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org/). 
If you haven't experienced AsciiDoc's power compared to e.g. Markdown, you should definitely give it a try!
